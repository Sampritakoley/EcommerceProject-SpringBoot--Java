It includes product management, user authentication, shopping cart functionality, order processing, and more.

## This project has  a modular structure with a focus on separation of concerns, enabling easy development, testing, and maintenance

# Model Layer: 
Contains entities or domain objects representing the core business concepts, such as Product, User, Order, CartItem, etc.
# Repository Layer:
Uses Spring Data JPA for database interactions. This layer provides CRUD operations for entities.
# Service Layer: 
Contains business logic. This layer orchestrates the interaction between repositories and controllers.
# Controller Layer:
Handles HTTP requests and maps them to specific endpoints. Typically uses RESTful architecture.
# Configuration Layer:
Contains Spring Boot configuration files, beans, and other setup-related code.
# Security Layer: 
Handles user authentication and authorization. Spring Security is commonly used for this purpose.
